Deployments
A Deployment manages a set of Pods to run an application workload, usually one that doesn't maintain state.
A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

Use Case
The following are typical use cases for Deployments:

Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not.
Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment.
Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment.
Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load.
Pause the rollout of a Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout.
Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.
Clean up older ReplicaSets that you don't need anymore.

# Creating a Deployment

The following is an example of a Deployment. It creates a ReplicaSet to bring up three nginx Pods:

vi  my-deploy.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80


In this example:

A Deployment named nginx-deployment is created, indicated by the .metadata.name field. This name will become the basis for the ReplicaSets and Pods which are created later. See Writing a Deployment Spec for more details.

The Deployment creates a ReplicaSet that creates three replicated Pods, indicated by the .spec.replicas field.

The .spec.selector field defines how the created ReplicaSet finds which Pods to manage. In this case, you select a label that is defined in the Pod template (app: nginx). However, more sophisticated selection rules are possible, as long as the Pod template itself satisfies the rule.

Note:
The .spec.selector.matchLabels field is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". All of the requirements, from both matchLabels and matchExpressions, must be satisfied in order to match.
The .spec.template field contains the following sub-fields:

The Pods are labeled app: nginxusing the .metadata.labels field.
The Pod template's specification, or .spec field, indicates that the Pods run one container, nginx, which runs the nginx Docker Hub image at version 1.14.2.
Create one container and name it nginx using the .spec.containers[0].name field.
Before you begin, make sure your Kubernetes cluster is up and running. Follow the steps given below to create the above Deployment:

# Create the Deployment by running the following command:

kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml


# Run kubectl get deployments to check if the Deployment was created.

If the Deployment is still being created, the output is similar to the following:

# kubectl get deployments

NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   0/3     0            0           1s


When you inspect the Deployments in your cluster, the following fields are displayed:

NAME lists the names of the Deployments in the namespace.
READY displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users. It follows the pattern ready/desired.
UP-TO-DATE displays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.
AVAILABLE displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
AGE displays the amount of time that the application has been running.
Notice how the number of desired replicas is 3 according to .spec.replicas field.


# Run the kubectl get deployments again a few seconds later. The output is similar to this:

#  kubectl get deployments 

NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           18s


# To see the labels automatically generated for each Pod, run kubectl get pods --show-labels. The output is similar to:

NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       LABELS
